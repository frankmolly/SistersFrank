Sunday 2/24/14 10AM-12PM

We met with our group today and wrote stories for Genetic Programming.
We wrote three stories in pivotal tracker and tried to discuss the project.

Tuesday 2/25/14 7-7:30PM

We met as a group to discuss new project ideas because none of us can
grasp the idea of Genetic Programming. This will be our third project
change.

Wednesday 2/26/14

Talked to Dr.Ribler about the group's discussion to change topics again.
Was told to pick a new project and focus on pair programming and test-
driven development.

Thursday 2/27/14 1-2:15PM

We decided as a group to start creating a Solitaire game as a new project.
We wrote a few stories in pivotal tracker, and the three of us began
writing some tests together.

Sunday 3/2/14 11AM-12PM

We met as a group to edit some of our stories we'd created in class, and
to break some down as tasks. We did a bit more pair programming and creating
of tests.

Wednesday 3/5/14 7PM-8:20

We began officially our journal. Programmed as a pair for solitaire. We did
not get far because we created vectors in our program and then decided to
change everything to a more convenient array in our add function.

Thursday 3/6/14 11:30AM-12PM

We've been asked to change our project from being written in C++ to C#. Hannah
gave me an article explaining the differences between the two languages, so
we reviewed the article, discussed the new stories she'd made with Dr.Ribler
this morning, and broke some into tasks.

Thursday 3/6/14 7:30-9:30

We worked on trying to get our Visual Studios files onto git. We're having a very difficult
time figuring out how to use github and git. We tried downloading new updates to
Visual Studios, practiced using the Powershell, tried "cloning" our repository
to our desktop, etc.

Monday 3/10/14 2-5PM

Spent a few minutes recording our previously hand-written journal onto a file we can
put into git. Then we spent some time trying to get our journals on github. We updated
and created story points on pivotal tracker, and decided what our task was to work
on today. Worked on the Deck class together using test-driven development.

Wednesday 3/12/14 1-2:30PM

Researched some differences between C# and C++ online, because I'm having difficulty 
with the difference.

Tuesday 3/18/14 5-7PM

Continued to read up on C#. Coding is going very slowly because of the lack of knowledge
of C#. Cannot figure out how to add things to an array correctly. 

Wednesday 3/19/14 8-9:30PM

Spent a good half hour trying to figure out how to open any of our code that we had saved
on git. Tried to do some more testing and pair programming tonight once we got to our code.
Finding the differences between C# and C++ to be confusing. A lot of failed tests run, but
not a lot of good tests accomplished.

Thursday 3/20/14 2:15PM-3:15PM

Spent time after class trying to put all the individual 52 cards into a deck. Movement
was very slow. Dr.Ribler gave us some pointers on how to cast so we could use the enumerators.

same day 7:30PM-8:45PM

Tried to test the newly created deck, and tried to test our print function. Our print function
is also a test to see if all the cards are filling into the deck properly. Next step is 
creating the shuffle function so we can print the deck out and see the difference after it
has been shuffled. 

Friday 3/21/14 5PM-6:30PM

Spent some time reading more in the C# book. Contemplated changing the data structures we're
using for our program. Also, we learned about interfaces the other day, and so tried to
think out how we could add something like that into our program. Not sure if it's appropriate.

Sunday 3/23/14 3PM-4PM

Worked some more on trying to print out the Deck once the Cards have been loaded into it. Still
not getting anywhere.
